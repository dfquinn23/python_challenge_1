# python_challenge_1
Class assignment

I worked for hours and hours on this and simply do not understand the ins and outs of Pythoin coding well enough yet to be able to complete this assignment onm my own. I'm attaching two files, one that was my own failed attempt that I simply could not untangle, and a second file that I completed as best as I could on my own, then went to chatgpt to help with completion.

I am not sure how this will be graded. I am submitting it because it's important that it be completed and that you see that I struggled with it. If/when my coding skills improve, I would be willing to revist this assignemt if need be. Otherwise, I continue to work on my skills and hope to catch up with what is hbappening. I have a tutoring session set for Tuesday ther 28th.
